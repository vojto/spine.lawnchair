## Motivation

Lawnchair is an interesting library for persisting data on client side. There are multiple adapters, each specifying a new way to store data locally on client.

For example [PhoneGap-SQLite](https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin) lets you store data in a limitless SQLite database through PhoneGap bridge.

## About

It stores new key-value pair for each record. Spine's default local storage implementation stores the whole collection in a key-value pair.

Inspired by Spine's Ajax adapter and existing similiar [project](https://github.com/bryanchow/spine-lawnchair).
